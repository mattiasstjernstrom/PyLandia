Each boss can have unique arenas that further emphasize their programming concept. For instance, Captain Compiler's arena could be filled with code snippets, and players might need to "correct" the syntax to weaken him. Designing battles around these bosses will not only be entertaining but also educational for players as they grapple with the principles these foes embody.
