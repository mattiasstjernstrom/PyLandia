### Basic combat loop

1. Initialise combat class with player and enemy entity
2. Player chooses action through input
3. Run function based on player input
4. If enemy is still alive it attacks players, else player wins and combat ends.
5. If player is still alive go to step 2, else enemy loses and combat ends (and game?).
