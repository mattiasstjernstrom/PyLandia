## **Notes from first meeting**
Wednesday 25/10/2023

**Attendance:**
Carl, Daniel, Jens, Jocke, Mattias, Mobin, Shoua

**Basis:**
"PyLandia Null" - We'll start with the documents from GitWeek PyLandia and start from there, making changes as needed.

**Vision:**
* Combat interface inspired by Pok√©mon games / jrpgs
* Grid-based 'overworld' navigation
* Based in PyLandia's initial documents, but changed at our leisure.
* Edutainment-vibe? Something for future students to practice programming with.
* Possibility of incorporating other programming languages into the game world?
* End boss could be Python the python.
* Challenges based on coding.

**Style guide:**
* Pep8: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/
* Strive for proper use of private/public attributes and methods in classes, and the like.

**Structure:**
* Coordinator/Coordinator group keeps tabs on what's needed and produces a list of tasks for participants to volunteer for.
    * Make sure to keep the complexity of tasks varied so that coders can help regardless of skill level.
    * Initial coordinators are Mattias and Daniel.
* Merges need to be performed by a participant not involved in the commits.
    * Possible exceptions for minor spelling edits and tweaks with low impact.
* Public repository - fosters inviting view into the work and might help recruit more interested people.
* We'll use the class Discord for main communication. Coordinators make semi-regular updates on the 'state of the game' to show where we're at.
